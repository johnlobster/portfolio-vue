        I am a fullstack developer and have been living in Folsom, California
        for over 20 years.
      </p>
      <p> Previous to becoming a fullstack developer I designed computer chips.
        I was at Intel for nearly 20
        years, where
        I worked on chipsets and later developing the internal graphics for
        CPUs. Before Intel, I worked for ARM, in
        CPU design.
      </p>
      <p> I moved from England to the United States in 1996, but some of my
        accent is still present.
      </p>
      <p>
        My degree, from Bristol University in England, is in Computer Systems
        Engineering, where I achieved first
        class honours.
      </p>
      <p>I have two children, and with whatever time I have left I enjoy the
        outdoors - hiking, cycling and skiing</p>

        I thoroughly enjoyed this class. I have been coding and learning new
        languages and concepts since the
        age of 12, so web programming is a great fit. There are new web
        languages, libraries and frameworks
        coming out all the time and this is analogous to chip design where the
        underlying technology changes
        every two years and methodologies and tools must adapt - I love this
        need for continually improving.
        The class studied basic concepts but I studied way beyond that.
